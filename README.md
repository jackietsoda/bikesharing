# Bikesharing

## Analysis

The purpose of this project is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, I have created a bike trip analysis. For this analysis, I did the following: 

- Showed the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Showed the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Showed the gender breakdown
- Showed the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
- Showed the top starting and ending locations

After doing all this work, I used these visualizations for my final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors. Here is the link: wfjirhguwhfiowf

## Results

Here are the following visuals for my project:

**1. Checkout Times for Users**

This graph shows that the majority of trips taken on CitiBike bikes are under an hour in length.

**2. Checkout Times by Gender**

This graph shows the number of rides by duration by gender. Males check out bikes about 3 time more than females and 5 times more than unknown.

**3. Gender Breakdown**

We can see that males use the bike sharing service for than females or those labeled unknown.

**4. Trips by Weekday for Each Hour**

Rides during the week, specifically during 7-9am and 5-7pm, have the highest bike rides. This is probably due to commuting during rush hour.

**5. Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)**

Males use the bike riding service during rush hour more than females or unknown.

Male subscribers using the bike sharing service the most on Thursdays and Fridays.

**7. Top Starting and Ending Locations**

The top starting and ending location is around Manhattan Island, probably due to workers commuting here and also a big tourist attraction.

## Summary

In August 2019, there are 2,344,224 bike rides in New York - that is quite a lot! Most of the rides are taken between the hours of 7-9am and 5-7pm, probably because people usually work during the day, so they use the ride shaaring service to commute to work and from work. Males comprise of 65% of all the bike rides, which is much more than those who are "Female" or "Unknown". New York is known for having lots of traffic, so most civilians choose to use public transportation rather than having a car ot getting in a taxi.

I would add the following analysis in the future:

- Compare data for different seasons in New York to see the correlation between the number of rides and the weather outside
- Start and end location during morning and evening rush hours to see if Manhattan is still more crowded than other areas
